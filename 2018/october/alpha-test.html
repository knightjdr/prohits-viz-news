<p>
	The alpha test for the 2.0 version of ProHits-viz has begun. It
	can be accessed at:
	<a href="https://prohits-viz.lunenfeld.ca/v2">prohits-viz.lunenfeld.ca/v2</a>.
</p>
<p>
	We are currently testing only the dot plot tool with its associated interactive
	viewer. Some features from the previous version of the interactive viewer have
	not yet been implemented, including domain and network analysis, as well as
	image archiving.
</p>
<p>
	To make our tools more approachable for those outside the interaction proteomics
	community, all bait and prey nomenclature has (or will be) converted to
	"condition" and "readout". This will affect file naming, so what would previously
	have been called bait-bait.svg will now be condition-condition.svg.
</p>
<p>
	New features include the ability to save interactive sessions to a file or the
	browser, navigate large images using the new "minimap" feature, sort conditions by
	readout abundance either by condition or for one condition relative to another
	(fold-change), as well as several new ways of selecting conditions/readouts for
	analysis and image customization.
