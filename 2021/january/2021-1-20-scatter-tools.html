<p>
  Support for scatter plot analysis, including condition-condition analysis (formerly called
  bait-bait) and readout specificity has been added to ProHits-viz 2.0.
</p>
<p>
  These tools come with an updated interactive viewer that allows for customization of
  the colour and size of points, addition of fold-change lines, toggling between linear and
  log axes, and selection of points for analysis, such as GO enrichment. You can try out the new
  features with
  an <a href="https://prohits-viz.org/visualization/samplefile/specificity">example dataset</a>.
