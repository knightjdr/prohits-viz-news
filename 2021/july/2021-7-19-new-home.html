  July 18, 2021 was the last day of official support for our old ProHits-viz site hosted at prohits-viz.lunenfeld.ca.
  Over the course of its four years of existence, it performed over 75 000 analysis and visualization tasks. While
  it is still used extensively by the community, we felt it was in need of a redesign that would allow us to more easily
  add new tools and interactive features going forward.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://prohits-viz.org">ProHits-viz.org</a> is the new redesigned home of ProHits-viz. This new site has
  an overhauled interface, with extensive online help and video tutorials to aid when you get stuck. It also
  comes with a <a href="https://prohits-viz.org/help/analysis/scv">brand new tool</a> for visualizing multiple
  output metrics from a single experimental condition.
</p>
<p>
  There is plenty of online help at <a href="https://prohits-viz.org/help">prohits-viz.org/help</a> and
  a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGR-0ixL4z526JUVQU8P4xQ/playlists">videos</a> that
  demonstrate how to use the new interactive viewers.
</p>
<p>
  If you have questions that are not covered by the help, you can contact us
  at <a href="mailto:contact@prohits-viz.org">contact@prohits-viz.org</a>

  A final note on the old site: any images that were archived there will still be accessible, but
  all other links will redirect to the new site.
