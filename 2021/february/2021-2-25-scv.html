  There is a new tool for visualizing data on a single condition (for example a bait in
  a protein-protein interaction data set). It will display significant readouts in a circular
  heat map format, with the option to display multiple columns from the input file.

  The image can be supplemented with either protein or RNA expression data from a range of
  cell lines and tissues. For protein-protein interaction data, the image can also be sorted
  between known and novel interactions.

  You can try out the new tool with an
