<p>
	The beta test for the 2.0 version of ProHits-viz has begun. It
	can be accessed at: <a href="https://prohits-viz.org">prohits-viz.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We are currently testing the correlation and dot plot tools with their associated
  interactive viewer.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the features mentioned in the alpha test and further bug fixes, you
  can now filter interactive images by conditions (e.g. baits) to limit the readouts (e.g. preys) displayed
  on the image. This is particular useful when combined with sorting to provide a more focused
  look at two conditions. You can also open as many snapshots and analyses of your image as
  you would like. You can try out the new features with
  an <a href="https://prohits-viz.org/visualization/samplefile/dotplot">example dataset</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If you would like to provide feedback, report bugs or request new features, please
	use GitHub. If your issue has already been created on GitHub by someone else, you do not need
	to do anything unless you would like to provide additional comments or context.
